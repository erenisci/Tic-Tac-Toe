# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

This repository contains a tic-tac-toe (XOX) game project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created as a weekend project after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. It hosts my tic-tac-toe game project, implemented with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, serving as a practice project to solidify my understanding of frontend web development concepts.
